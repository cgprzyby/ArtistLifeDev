# ArtistLifeDev
Game for CS3141. Developer Repository for Team 4.

Level/Progression based game built using libGDX and Java for Desktop.

To Run: Import the project into your existing workspace in Eclipse, select the DesktopLauncher class from the ArtistLife-Desktop project and run like normal. 

If youre using something other than eclipse, I dunno if I can help. IntelliJ has trouble with the gradle tasks by default and I just dont use NetBeans/(Other IDE Name Here).
